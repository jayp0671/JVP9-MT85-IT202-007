<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Describe your change/modification</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The first change I implemented into the game was adding more collectible squares.<br>For example, the original game only had the player&#39;s movable square and one<br>green-colored collectible square. With this change, there are also now blue squares, pink<br>squares, red squares, and gold squares. Here is how it works. The green<br>squares give one point as usual. The blue squares give you two points.<br>The pink squares give five points. The red square DEDUCTS one point (so<br>you try to avoid that). The gold square acts as a power-up. When<br>you collect the gold square, it takes your current score and adds 50%<br>of it to your current score. What I mean is if you have<br>10 points and you collect the golden square, you now have 15 points,<br>because 50% of 10 is 5, and 5 is added to 10. (I<br>used the &quot;round&quot; function to ensure that if this power-up is picked up<br>and you have an odd score, you don&#39;t end up getting points ending<br>in .5). However, the golden square power-up only spawns after 5 seconds. For<br>example, if you pick up that power-up, it respawns after 5000 milliseconds (or<br>5 seconds). This is to&nbsp; make sure the player doesn&#39;t just keep picking<br>up the power-up.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>My second significant change is that I added a moving obstacle block in<br>the game. It is a gray block (about the size of the player&#39;s<br>square) that moves horizontally in the canvas. It will travel on a random<br>x-axis value every time. It goes from the right to the left and<br>changes its elevation once it crosses the border. This obstacle is dangerous. If<br>the player&#39;s square touches/collides with the obstacle, the game ends.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>This picture shows the gray square. In the other picture, it was on<br>the left side of the border. It moves from right to left and<br>once it crosses completely, the x-value changes in elevation, so the block travels<br>in different longitudes.<br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>This assignment was surprisingly fun. Playing around with the Canvas API was fun.<br>It was fun making squares, power-ups, and even an obstacle course move around<br>with just JavaScript. Learning to handle arrow key inputs made it all feel<br>like I was controlling the screen. The collision detection stuff was like setting<br>up rules for a game of tag, making sure things collided when they<br>were supposed to. Wrapping it all up in functions made it less of<br>a headache, more like putting together LEGO blocks. I learned a lot of<br>cool features and coding segments throughout this assignment. This was a very cool<br>assignment. I got to express my creativity and thoughts for this and I<br>loved it.&nbsp;<br></div><br></td></tr>
