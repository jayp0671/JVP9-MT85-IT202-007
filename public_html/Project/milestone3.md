<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Consider how your API data will be associated with a user</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>The API data will be associated with the user through the concept of<br>"Favorites." Users will have the ability to mark recipes from the API as<br>their favorites (or the recipes they manually create). These favorites will be stored<br>in the database, creating a direct association between the user and the specific<br>recipes they have chosen. This association allows users to easily access and manage<br>their favorite recipes through their profiles. In my application, users can browse a<br>big collection of recipes sourced from an external API. When a user finds<br>a recipe they like, they can add it to their list of favorites.<br>This association between the user and their favorite recipes enables a personalized experience.<br>Users can conveniently revisit their favorite recipes to use them as a basis<br>for creating their own recipes. In this case, the API data enhances user<br>engagement by allowing them to curate a collection of recipes tailored to their<br>tastes.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Handling Data Changes</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>When the admin updates the entity, the user sees the updated version of<br>the data. This is because all recipe data is stored in the database,<br>and all edits to the recipe are made through the database, so any<br>update to the recipe will be updated on every user&#39;s favorite page. The<br>update logic involves checking if a recipe in the user&#39;s favorites has been<br>modified by the admin or through an update from the API. If the<br>recipe is updated manually by the admin, the changes are straightforwardly reflected in<br>every user&#39;s favorites. If the update is from the API, if the recipe<br>is already in the database, then the update won&#39;t take place, but if<br>the user searches for the recipe again, they can add the updated recipe<br>into the database.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>There were some issues I ran into while working on this, so I<br>have modified some parts of the requirements for partial credit (approved by the<br>professor). So, the form partial matches the username and the recipe title (for<br>this specific example, I typed in &quot;Chicken&quot; for title and put &quot;1&quot; for<br>the username and this was shown. The only thing different with the modification<br>is that instead of using checkboxes, I have radio buttons for toggling entity<br>data. This is because I was having issues connecting multiple users with one<br>recipe, so instead decided to use radio buttons instead. The concept is still<br>the same, when toggled the code can add/remove the selected recipe from the<br>selected user&#39;s favorites.<br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Explain the code logic for this page</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>The PHP code smoothly manages the association of entities with users on the<br>"All Users Association Page." Users can enter partial matches for both the title<br>(entity) and username using a simple form. The code then fetches partially matched<br>entities (recipes) and users based on the input. The association process involves users<br>selecting an entity and a user from the results using radio buttons. The<br>code checks if the association already exists and, if so, removes it; otherwise,<br>it establishes the connection. "To enhance clarity", radio buttons are used instead of<br>checkboxes. Error handling is in place to prevent unintentional duplicate associations. Clicking the<br>"Apply Associations" button updates the associations in the database, and users are redirected<br>to the "all_users_association.php" page, making the entire process straightforward and user-friendly.</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Document any issues/struggles</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>While working on the "All Users Association Page," I encountered a couple of<br>challenges that needed some tweaking for smoother functionality. Originally, I planned to use<br>checkboxes for users to select multiple entities (based on the requirements), but due<br>to technical constraints, I opted for a simpler solution using radio buttons, making<br>the process more straightforward. Another hiccup involved preventing accidental duplicate associations. To tackle<br>this, I added a check to see if the association already existed. If<br>it did, the code removed it, and if not, it established a new<br>connection. This adjustment ensured we avoided any unintended data duplication. By simplifying the<br>user interface and adding these checks, the "All Users Association Page" now works<br>seamlessly, providing an easy and reliable experience for users.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Highlight any favorite topics</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Working on connecting user data with their favorite recipes was a standout experience<br>for me. I enjoyed figuring out how to make it easy for users<br>to manage their preferences, like adding or removing recipes from their favorites. Toggling<br>recipes with radio buttons simplified the process, making it more user-friendly. This aspect<br>of web development, centered around making interactions smooth and enjoyable, has become a<br>favorite of mine. I'm excited about exploring it further and making these experiences<br>even more straightforward for users.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Overall how do you feel you did with the project and meeting requirements</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Overall, I feel confident about my performance on the project and meeting the<br>requirements. Navigating through the challenges, particularly in handling data associations and creating user-friendly<br>interfaces, allowed me to grow my understanding of web development. While there were<br>hiccups along the way, I was able to overcome them with a combination<br>of research, problem-solving, and some modifications as guided by the professor. This project<br>has been a valuable learning experience, and I'm proud of the progress made<br>in connecting user data with their favorite recipes, making it more intuitive and<br>user-friendly.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Summarize your experience per the checklist items</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>When I entered the class, I had some basic development experience, particularly in<br>HTML and CSS, but my understanding of more complex web development concepts was<br>limited. Throughout the course, my experience has significantly improved. I now feel more<br>confident in handling PHP and MySQL interactions, which were initially challenging. Reflecting on<br>the project, I might consider incorporating more modular code structures and planning to<br>streamline the development process. Overall, I've gained valuable insights into web development, and<br>I'm excited to continue building on this foundation.</div><br></td></tr>
