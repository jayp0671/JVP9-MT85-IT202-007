    2. **Important**: The function that drives one of the challenges is `updateCurrentPage(str)` which takes 1 parameter, a string of the word to display as the current page. This function is not included in the code of the page, along with a few other things, are linked via an external js file. Make sure you do not delete this line.  
5. Create a branch called M3-Challenge-HW if you haven't yet
6. Add this template to that branch (git add/git commit)
7. Make a pull request for this branch once you push it
8. You may manually deploy the HW branch to dev to get the evidence for the below prompts
9. Create a new file **m3_submission.md** file in the hw branch and fill it with the output generated from this page (be careful not to paste more than once)
10. Add, commit, and push the submission file
11. Close the pull request by merging it to dev (double-check all looks good on dev)
12. Manually create a new pull request from dev to prod (i.e., base: prod <- compare: dev)
13. Complete the merge to deploy to production
14. Submit the direct link of the m3_submission.md from the prod branch to Canvas for this submission

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Briefly explain how you made the navigation horizontal</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>I made the navigation horizontal by using CSS properties. I used display: flex;<br>to the &lt;ul&gt; element, which made the list items into a horizontal row.<br>The justify-content: space-around; property gave the list equal spacing, making them appear horizontally<br>aligned. This solution worked because the flex display property is designed to control<br>the layout and arrangement of elements, which allowed for easy horizontal structuring of<br>the menu.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how you remove the navigation list item markers</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>I removed the navigation list item markers by setting list-style: none; for the<br>&lt;ul&gt; element inside the navigation. This removes the default bullet points or numbers<br>associated with list items in HTML. By applying this style, I got rid<br>of the markers, making the navigation items appear without any unwanted symbols or<br>indicators.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Briefly explain how you gave the navigation a background</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>I gave the navigation a background by setting background: #eee; for the &lt;ul&gt;<br>element inside the navigation. This assigned a grayish color to the navigation menu.<br>I did initially try to make it light blue/red but went with the<br>light gray color instead for it to look more professional and to ensure<br>that the user is able to read the contents of the website with<br>ease.&nbsp;</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Briefly explain how you made the links (or their surrounding area) change color on mouseover/hover</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>I learned that when you move your mouse over a link, it triggers<br>a style change (hover effect). In this case, I used the nav a:hover<br>selector to target the anchor elements inside the navigation when they are being<br>hovered over. I set the color property to red (you can't see my<br>mouse in the screenshots because of the screenshotting software but you can see<br>that it is highlighted). When the mouse hovers over a link, it changes<br>the text color to red. This&nbsp;provides visual feedback to the user that the<br>link is interactive.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Briefly explain how you changed the challenge list bullet points to checkmarks (✓)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>I targeted the list items inside the challenges list with the ul li::before<br>selector. Then, I used the content property to replace the default bullet points<br>with a checkmark character (✓). By setting content: "✓", I made the browser<br>display a checkmark before each list item. This solution worked because the ::before<br>pseudo-element in CSS allows us to insert content before the actual element, which<br>lets us customize the bullet points.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 6: </em> Briefly explain how you made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>I used text-transform: uppercase; to h1:first-letter and nav a:first-letter selectors. This tells the<br>browser to transform the first letter of the content in these elements to<br>uppercase. This solution works because the text-transform property allows for easy text formatting,<br>converting the first character of the specified elements to uppercase.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 7: </em> Briefly explain/describe your custom styling of your choice</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>I used text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); it adds a<br>very light shadow to the text, making it very subtly stand out but<br>not too noticeable. This effect is incredibly subtle because I did not want<br>to make it look too weird. (Had to do a little learning to<br>do this).</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 8: </em> Briefly explain how the styling for the challenge list doesn't impact the navigation list</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>The styling for the challenge list doesn't impact the navigation list because distinct<br>CSS selectors were used for each. Styles were specifically applied to the challenge<br>list items using ul li::before, which makes sure that they don't interfere with<br>the navigation menu styled using nav ul and nav a. By doing so,<br>the styles remained isolated to their intended sections, preventing unintended effects on other<br>parts of the webpage.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 9: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the h1 tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>I updated the content of the &lt;h1&gt; tag with the link text by<br>using JavaScript. When a link is clicked, the JavaScript code gets the text<br>content of the clicked link and assigns it to the &lt;h1&gt; tag. This<br>was done by using the textContent property in JavaScript to get the text<br>of the clicked link and updating the &lt;h1&gt; tag with this value. This<br>works because it responds in real time to user interactions, making sure that<br>the &lt;h1&gt; tag always displays the text corresponding to the clicked navigation link.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 10: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the title tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>I updated the content of the &lt;title&gt; tag with the link text using<br>JavaScript. When a link is clicked, the event listener captures the text content<br>of the clicked link. This text is then combined with a prefix to<br>form the new title. The JavaScript code sets this new title by assigning<br>it to the document.title property. By updating document.title, the browser's title bar displays<br>the relevant link text, making sure that users see a title corresponding to<br>the clicked link.</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I didn&#39;t really have too many difficulties. I had to research a little<br>bit for some of them to see the exact format of the parameters<br>for CSS and JavaScript for some of the problems, but nothing too bad.<br>I learned a lot of new parameters and this was frankly one of<br>my first times working with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS so it was a<br>great learning experience. I also initially had problems with getting the right URL<br>from Heroku, but I overlooked the simple addition of the /challenge.html because I&#39;m<br>stupid. Thankfully, everything worked out and I am able to submit this in<br>time.<div><br></div><div>For the record, I forgot to copy URL when I was making the<br>pull request so I attached the link to the merged request.
